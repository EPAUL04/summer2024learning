            <h1>Programming Tips</h1>
            <p>
                This textbook has a chapter full of tips to help produce good code and help you stay happy during that 
                process. Very important and useful info. Here is a link: 
                <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Debugging/toctree.html">Ch 3</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make sure to fully understand what you want to do first. Many professors recommend writing out the steps 
                that you will take in your program first, either in plain writing or in pseudocode (if p == 1 add 
                2 is psuedocode, because it says what you want to do but isn't fully accurate code).
            </p>
            <p>
                Start with something small and make sure it works before moving on to the next part. Once you get 
                something that works, you can continue adding to it. It is easier to do this than to try to do 
                everything at once and go back and check it later. This also "creates a lot of small victories for 
                yourself" which helps keep the whole process from being evil and draining and boring. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to test as you go. This helps you verify that your code is working and eliminate edge 
                cases that may arise unexpectedly. 
            </p>


            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>
                Python is a high-level programming language. Low-level programming languages 
                are also called machine languages or assembly languages, and they are the  
                information passed directly to the computer to instruct it. High-level languages 
                are ways of coding that the computer must process before it can understand and 
                execute. It is easier to write in high-level languages. Additionally, high-level 
                language code is 'portable' in that it can be processed and run on/by multiple 
                types of computer, while low-level languages are specific to one kind of computer.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two kinds of programs to process high-level languages. Interpreters read 
                the code and execute it by alternating between reading lines of code and performing 
                computations. Compilers read the program completely before starting to run the code. 
                It takes in source code (the high-level language code) and converts it to object 
                code/the executable (low-level language translation of source code). Once code is 
                compiled, it can be run repeatedly. In contrast, interpreters have the same process 
                of reading and running every time, regardless of whether they have seen the code 
                before. Many modern languages use both processes. First, a compiler converts source 
                code into byte code, which is interpreted by a virtual machine. Python does this, 
                but is more broadly considered an interpreted language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shell mode is a way of using the Python interpreter where you type Python expressions 
                into the Python shell, which spits out a result. This is helpful for testing small bits 
                of code where you want immediate feedback. Program mode is when you instead write a 
                program in a file (the source code) and pass it to the interpreter. 
            </p>
            <h3>.py</h3>
            <p>
                When in program mode, end the name of your source code with .py to tell the intepreter 
                that it is a Python program. Run this program by calling python filename.py in the 
                command line.
            </p>
            <h3>Formal and Natural Language</h3>
            <p>
                Natural language is spoken language that evolved naturally. Formal languages are developed 
                specifically and intentionally with a specific purpose or application in mind. Mathematics, 
                chemistry, and programming all use formal languages to standardize syntax and make work 
                legible to other people. Formal languages therefore have strict syntax rules in a way that 
                natural language does not. If you say "hillo", English speakers will most likely gather that 
                you wanted to convey a greeting, but if you say "5 s 2", mathematicians will be unlikely to 
                understand that you wanted to subtract 2 from 5.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tokens are the basic elements of a language, such as words, numbers, or chemical elements. 
                Structure is the way that the tokens are arranged. It is especially important in a formal 
                language to ensure that you are using the correct tokens and structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Parsing is the process of figuring out what a language expression means, such as reading a 
                sentence and interpreting that this word is a verb and that one a subject and so on. Once 
                you have parsed a sentence, you can figure out what the sentence means, which is its 
                semantics.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are other differences between natural and formal languages. Formal languages are 
                intentionally unambiguous (for the most part...) so that every statement has one 
                interpretation which does not rely on context. Formal languages also aim for less 
                redundancy and for brevity. Finally, formal languages are very literal and lack idiom 
                and metaphor. Formal languages are often dense, for all the reasons given above.
            </p>


            <h1>How to Actually Code!</h1>
            <h3>Basic Computations</h3>
            <p>
                A program tells a computer how to perform some action. Here are the basic intructions 
                you will see and use:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>input: get data from somewhere</li>
                <li>output: display data to somewhere</li>
                <li>math: perform basic mathematical operations</li>
                <li>logic: perform basic logic operations (and/or/not/etc)</li>
                <li>conditionals: perform some action based on a certain condition</li>
                <li>repetition: perform an action some number of times</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Bugs and Errors</h3>
            <p>
                Programming errors are called bugs, and debugging is just the process of finding and 
                correcting them. There are three kinds of errors: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Syntax errors: an error in formatting that the compiler/interpeter cannot read/process.</li>
                <li>
                    Runtime errors: an error that has correct syntax but produces an invalid result. 
                    These only appear when you run the program, because the interpeter/compiler can read 
                    the code without detecting issues. They are also called exceptions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Semantic errors: an error in which the program runs successfully but produces a 
                    different result than you wanted it to.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p>
                Comments are a great way to make your code more legible/understandable. They are little 
                bits of text that the intepreter/compiler ignores. Some examples of when it is helpful to 
                include a comment are: to explain how a confusing part of code works, to explain what a 
                program or specific method does when you know you will need to look back at something later, 
                to suggest parts of your code to check for errors, to keep old code that you don't want run 
                but may want to look back at, to explain to an instructor why you did things a certain way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blank lines between code are also ignored by the interpreter/compiler but can make your code 
                a lot neater and more legible, so it is good programming practice to use them liberally.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Types!</h3>
            <p>
                A value/object is something such as a word or number that a program can use or manipulate. 
                There are different data types that a value can fall under.
            </p>
            <p>
                A string is a data type that usually contains a word or phrase, although numbers can be part 
                of a string. A string is enclosed in quotation marks; either " " or ' ' work. When you use " ", 
                you can include ' ' as a character within your string, such as "Joy's cat" or "said 'meow'". 
                The reverse is also true; strings denoted by ' ' can contain " " as a character. You can also 
                use ''' ''' or """ """ if you want to include both ' ' and " " in your string. This is called 
                a triple quoted string. A string is referred to as str in Python.
            </p>
            <p>
                An integer is a whole number. It is referred to as int in Python. A floating point number is a 
                number with a decimal point. It is referred to as float in Python. Do not put commas or spaces
                in either of these, because that can change the way the compiler/interpreter reads the value.
            </p>
            <p>You can find out the data type of a value by using the type() function. It will not display to 
                the screen automatically, because sometimes you want to use that funtion within a conditional 
                or something, so if you want it to print to the screen, use the print function like this: 
                print(type(__)) with your value where the underline is.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also convert a value from one data type to another. Python is especially efficient at 
                this! It has built-in functions such as int(), float(), and str() to do this. These are type 
                conversion functions. There are, however, some rules about how to use them. For example, int() 
                can take a float or str and convert it to an int by discarding anything after any existing 
                decimal points. float() can take an int, and will add a .0 to the end of it. float() can also 
                take a string if the string has no tokens that would be invalid in a float. str() just sticks 
                quotes around whatever you give it to convert something into a string.
            </p>
            <h3>Variables &lt;3</h3>
            <p>
                A variable is a name that refers to a particular value. Assignment statements create variables 
                and assign them a value. It is very easy to create and assign a variable in Python. You just 
                give a variable a name (like var1) and assign it to a value (like 3) using the assignment 
                operator, which is just an equal sign. So it would just look like var1 = 3 and then my var1 
                variable is created, assigned, and ready to use!
            </p>
            <p>
                Variables often change, so you can reassign them in your code. The value of a variable is 
                whatever it was most recently assigned. To reassign a variable, use the exact same process that 
                was used to create it in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another thing to mention about assignment and reassignment is that you can set a variable equal 
                to another variable. This just means that the first variable takes on the value of the second 
                variable at the time of assignment, although one or both can change value later without affecting 
                the other. This actually is not true for other languages, such as Java! Python is much easier to 
                use when it comes to changing the values of variables.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most common reason a variable would be reassigned is that it is some sort of counter that 
                needs to update a total. Sometimes you will see x = x + 1, which is an expression that gets the 
                value of x and then sets the new value of x equal to the old value of x plus one. This works 
                because the interpeter/compiler first evaluates the expression on the right side of the 
                assignment operator, then sets the variable equal to that result. For this reason, this only works  
                with an existing variable. You cannot have this be the statement that creates the variable and 
                assigns it. The process of setting a variable equal to itself + 1 is called incrementing, and the 
                process of setting a variable equal to itself - 1 is called decrementing.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a lot of rules and conventions when it comes to naming variables. You cannot use a 
                space in a variable name. It is common to use underscores in place of spaces in long variable 
                names, such as price_of_item. You should start a variable name with a letter, not an underscore 
                or number, though it is common and accepted to use numbers in a variable name. Capitalization 
                matters, so cat and Cat are different variables. You also cannot use 'reserved characters' as a 
                variable name. Reserved characters are things like +, -, =, or keywords that refer to functions 
                (eg type or print). You can use those words within the variable name if you really want to, such 
                as var_type or str_to_print. Python programmers typically prefer to use lowercase letter in 
                variable names, especially for the first letter.
            </p>
            <h3>Statements vs Expressions</h3>
            <p>
                A statement is an insruction that an interpeter/compiler can execute, such as an assignment 
                statement. An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and functions that 
                a compiler/interpreter evaluates. If you print an expression, it will just print the result.
            </p>
            <h3>Operators and Operands</h3>
            <p>
                Operators are special tokens that have a specific purpose such as addition or assignment. The 
                values that they affect are called operands. Operands can be variables. Operators differ by 
                language, so the ones below are specific to Python in both what token they are represented by 
                and what they actually do.
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>+</dt>
                <dd>
                    Adds two values together if valid values are provided. Number + number = number and str + 
                    str = concatenated str (eg "two" + "three" results in "twothree").
                </dd>
                <dt>-</dt>
                <dd>Subtracts two numerical values if valid values are provided. Does not work for strings.</dd>
                <dt>*</dt>
                <dd>
                    Multiplies two values if appropriate values are provided. You can also multiply a string 
                    by an integer to concatenate the string to itself several times (eg "hi" * 3 results in "hihihi").
                </dd>
                <dt>**</dt>
                <dd>Exponentiation operator. The first value is multiplied by itself the number of times given by the 
                    second number (eg 2 ** 3 results in 8).
                </dd>
                <dt>/</dt>
                <dd>
                    Divides the first value by the second if appropriate values are provided. It always returns a 
                    floating point number as a result.
                </dd>
                <dt>//</dt>
                <dd>
                    This is called integer division, and it is used when you want to truncate the result and get an 
                    integer result. Note: it always rounds down to the lowest number, so when your result is negative, 
                    it is going to return the more negative number (eg 6//4 results in 1 but -6//4 results in -2 
                    because -6 divided by 4 is -1.5).
                </dd>
                <dt>%</dt>
                <dd>
                    This is the modulus operator, also sometimes called the remainder operator. It divides the first 
                    operand by the second and results in the remainder.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
                You can use multiple operators in an expression, and they will be evaluated following the rules of 
                precedence. This is generally the same as the mathematical rules of precedence (ie PEMDAS). Note: in 
                the rules of precedence, operators with equal precedence are left-associative ie go from left to 
                right. The exception to this is exponentials, which go from right to left. For example, 2 ** 3 ** 2 
                is 512 instead of 64 because instead of doing (2 ** 3) ** 2 and getting 8 squared, it does 2 ** (3 
                ** 2) and gets 2 to the ninth. In addition to using parenthesis to change the order of operation, 
                you can also use parenthesis extraneously just to make the expression easier to read. 
            </p>
            <h3>Functions</h3>
            <p>
                A function is a sequence of statements grouped together under a name that a program can call to execute 
                the statements at any time. They are used to organize programs and increase functionality. To create a 
                function, you use the "def" keyword followed by a name and parenthesis, in which you can add parameters 
                if you want to. All of this is followed by a colon and then your code to execute (indented from the line 
                above and lines below the function). This looks like:
            </p>
            <p class="psuedo">def name(parameter, parameter):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; statements</p><br>
            <p>
                The naming rules and conventions for functions in Python are, as far as I know, the same as the ones for 
                variables. Also, the parameters of a function are basically variables specific to the function. So 
                whatever parameters you use will be visible within the function but will not be declared in the typical 
                sense. When you call a function that has parameters, you call it by using the name of the function with 
                values to assign to the parameters in parenthesis, such as name(3, "for")
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also define variables within the function. Due to rules about variable accessibility, variables 
                created within the function will also not be accessible outside of the function (just like parameters). 
                Generally, in my limited experience, you do this when you only need the variable temporarily within the 
                function and don't want or need it to be seen outside the function. The benefit to defining parameters 
                is that you can pass them into the function with different values that change the functionality of the 
                function. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So as an example, if you have a function that returns a sum after it adds two to itself a 
                certain number of times, you might want to use a parameter to pass in the number of times you want it to 
                be added as well as a variable that starts at 2 and is updated until the function has executed the 
                appropriate amount of additions. That way, when you call the function, you can tell it how many times to 
                add two, but don't have to also provide the same variable of 0 every time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is also customary to include a docstring in your function. A docstring is just a special kind of comment 
                that exists mostly to describe what a function does. It has some special properties such as theoretically 
                being retrieved at runtime but I don't really know anything about that so. moving on.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you write a function, you may want it to just execute some steps such as opening a window or creating 
                an object. However, there are also a lot of times where you will want it to manipulate some value that you 
                will use again later in the code. This is when you would want to return that value. Returning something 
                means that when you call a function, it produces a value that you can store in a variable or feed as a 
                parameter into another function or something. You do this by putting the keyword "return" at the bottom of 
                your function, followed by a space and then a value. Usually this will be a variable, it is unlikely that 
                you would ever see something like "return 5". 
            </p>
            <p>
                A local variable is one that only exists within a subset of code such as a function, while a global variable is 
                one that exists within every part of the code that comes after the definition of the variable. The "lifetime" of 
                a local variable is the amount of time that it is valid/able to be used. If you use a local variable outside of 
                its lifetime (ie outside of a function it is created inside of), you will get an error message. Since the 
                lifetime of a global variable is the entire document, you can call a global variable within a function. However, 
                this is considered a bad coding practice, and should be avoided. If you want to access a global variable in your 
                function, the best way to go about doing that is to make a parameter and pass the variable into the function that way.
            </p>
            <h3>Main Function</h3>
            <p>
                Many languages don't allow you to just have code sitting at the bottom of your program to call things. Python doesn't rally care, 
                so you don't <em>have</em> to worry about a main function (more alliteratively known as the main method), but it is considered a 
                good coding practice to use one anyway. The main method just holds all the code that you need to actually run your program in one 
                function, and allows you to just call that at the bottom of your program. It's mostly just a way of organizing things, at least in 
                a Python document.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another reason to have a main method pertains to modules. Before an interpeter runs your program, it gets information on the program. 
                One piece of information that it collects is a variable called __name__, which defaults to the string value "__main__" when it finds 
                that the program is being run on itself. If the program is being imported by another program, then __name__ is set to the filename 
                of that module. This is used to determine when to execute or not execute the main method. If you are writing a program with the 
                intention of exporting it to another program, you may want to call your main method in a conditional instead of just calling it every 
                time your program runs. Your condition would be if __name__ == "__main__": and then it would call the main method.
            </p>
            <h3>Error Types</h3>
            <p>
                Nearly 90% of the errors that the authors of the textbook encountered while writing it were one of four 
                error types. Here are those errors and what they mean.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>ParseError: a syntax error which prevents the compiler/interpreter from parsing your code</li>
                <li>TypeError: an error that occurs when incompatible data types are provided and cannot be used</li>
                <li>
                    NameError: an error that arises when a variable name cannot be found for one reason or another. Often 
                    this comes from trying to use a variable before it has been assigned a value, or misspelling a variable 
                    you want to reference.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ValueError: when the value passed to a function is not compatible. For example, when you try to convert 
                    user input into an integer but the user did not type anything. This is different from a TypeError, which 
                    would be more like trying to convert the string "hi" into an integer.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Turtle Graphics</h3>
            <p>
                The next chapter is about how to use turtle graphics, which is a fun and cool thing you can do in Python that 
                allows you to create a little object on the screen called a turtle that you can move around and manipulate. I'm 
                going to leave this section blank for now and come back to it if need be, but here is a link to that part of the 
                book: <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/toctree.html">Ch 4</a>
            </p>
            <h3>Modules</h3>
            <p>
                A module is a file containing Python definitions and functions that you can use in your program. You import them 
                separately in order to use their functions and etc. You can find Python modules by looking at the Python 
                documentation <a href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/">here</a>. The documentation also has a lot of other useful 
                information and is worth checking out, I guess. When using something from a module, you use dot notation to tell 
                the interpeter/compiler that you are referencing the module. This is just using the name of the module, a dot, 
                and then the thing you're using. So to use the square root function in the math module, it would be math.sqrt()
            </p>
            <p>
                Other helpful modules include the math and random modules, which you can use to do more complex math and to pick 
                random values respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any source code that you write is technically a module, so you can import your own code and use your own methods 
                in other work by just saying "import filename" and omitting the .py
            </p>
            <h3>For Loops</h3>
            <p>
                A for loop is a valuable tool in programming that tells a program to execute specific steps a certain number of 
                times until some condition is met. I think the easiest way to show this is by going through an example. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Think about multiplication. multiplication is the process of adding a number to itself a certain number of times, 
                eg 2 times 5 is equal to 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2. So if we put this into a for loop, we would say for every time until we 
                reach the sixth time, add two to a sum variable. In order to perform that checking operation that stops the loop 
                from adding the 2 a sixth time, we can use the range function. This function returns a sequence of numbers between 
                0 and a specified number. So by using the range function, we are saying that the program should add 2 to a sum 
                variable for each time within the returned sequence of numbers given by range(). Here's the code:
            </p>
            <p class="psuedo">
                def multiply(num, by):<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; total = 0<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for n in range(by):<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; total = total + num<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return total<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                So what this is doing is taking the expression 2 * 5, where 2 is the "num" number and it is multiplied "by" 5. Then, it 
                is starting a sum variable called total at 0 so that the existing sum is 0. Then, it has a for loop that uses range 
                to stop the for loop on the "by"th (5th) repetition. It does this by calling range(by) to get the sequence of numbers 
                between 0 and "by", which is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 because range starts at 0 and stops "at" the number provided, not "on" it. 
                It is using a counter variable n to refer to each number in that list. So on the first run-through, n = 0. The total 
                is increased by our "num" number, which is 2. It has reached the end of the indented text, so it automatically 
                moves n forward by setting it to the next number in the sequence. So now n = 1. The process repeats, so 2 is added to 
                the total. Then n = 3, and 2 is added again. Then n = 4, and 2 is added again. Then n = 5, which is not in the 
                sequence, so the for loop sees that and stops performing actions. The next line of code after the for loop activates, 
                which is the return statement in this case. Since we've added 2 to the total variable on each of the five times the loop 
                ran, we should be returning a total of 10.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Selection</h3>
            <p>
                A bool is another data type used to store either of two values: True and False. These are different from strings and are 
                not contained by quotes. You can use an expression with logic operators to get a bool in Python, such as print("hel" + "lo"
                 == "hello") which will print the bool True to the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are seven comparison operators that return a boolean value by comparing two values:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>==</dt>
                <dd>Equality operator; checks whether two values are equivalent</dd>
                <dt>!=</dt>
                <dd>Checks whether two values are <em>in</em>equivalent</dd>
                <dt>&lt;</dt>
                <dd>Checks whether first value is less than second value</dd>
                <dt>&gt;</dt>
                <dd>Checks whether first value is greater than second value</dd>
                <dt>&lt;=</dt>
                <dd>Checks whether first value is less than or equal to second value</dd>
                <dt>&gt;=</dt>
                <dd>Checks whether first value is greater than or equal to second value</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>There are three logical operators which also return bools</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>and</dt>
                <dd>Only returns True if both expressions return True</dd>
                <dt>or</dt>
                <dd>Returns True if one of the expressions returns True</dd>
                <dt>not</dt>
                <dd>Only returns True if the expression returns False</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
                Something that could be important is that there is a hierarchy of operators. 
                First come the mathematical operators, with their own precedence still in place. 
                Then, the comparison operators. Finally, the logical operators. There is also a 
                hierarchy within the logical operators themselves, with "not" coming before "and" and 
                "and" coming before "or".
            </p>
            <h3>Conditionals</h3>
            <span class="group">
                <p>A selection statement, conditional statement, or conditional is a way of making sure a portion of your code only runs if 
                    certain conditions are true. The simplest form of selection statement is the if statement. An if statement looks like this:
                </p>
                <img src="images/if_statement.png" alt="if statement psuedocode">
            </span>
            <br>
            <span class="group">
                <p>
                    The boolean expression is called the condition. The if statement is fairly straightforward. If the condition is true, do 
                    this action. If it is not true, (else) do this other action. You do not need to include the else statement if you don't 
                    want to. In the case where an else statement is omitted, the code block under the if statement will run if the condition 
                    is met, and the compiler/interpreter will instead proceed to the text after the if statement if the condition is not met.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have more than one condition you want to check, there are a couple ways you can go about doing that. You can use 
                    a nested if statement, a compound condition, or an elif statement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you wanted to check that one condition was true first, and then check another condition once you knew it was true, you 
                    could use nested if statements. For example, if you wanted to find out if an animal was a lap dog, you could first check 
                    if the animal is a dog using an if-else statement. If the animal is a dog, you can then check its size with another if 
                    statement nested inside the "if" code block of the first if statement. This nested if statement would check the size of 
                    the dog, which would tell you whether the dog is a lap dog. Here's an example:
                </p>
                <img src="images/nested_if_statement.png" alt="if statement with a secondary if statement nested in the else statement">
            </span>
            <span class="group">
                <p>
                    If you wanted to check if one condition is true in combination with another condition, you could use a compound condition. 
                    You would use an if-else statement but change the condition in the if statement to use logical operators. Using the same 
                    lap dog example, we would change the if statement so that it checks the type of animal <em>and</em> the size of the animal. 
                    Here's what that would look like:
                </p>
                <img src="images/compound_condition_if_statement.png" alt="if statement with a compound condition using the and operator">
            </span>
            <span class="group">
                <p>
                    Finally, you can use an elif statement when you have multiple conditions that you want to check separately. Elif means "else 
                    if". When you use an elif statement, your if statement checks the condition. If the condition is not true, it proceeds to the 
                    elif statement and checks if that is true. This means that there are two separate checks. In our lap dog example, this is
                    actually kind of the least efficient way to do this just because we will have to use the compound condition if statement and
                    so may as well have just done that by itself. But here is an example using an elif statement:
                </p>
                <img src="images/elif_statement.png" alt="an elif statement">
                </span>
            <p>
                Another important thing to mention is that you can use multiple elif statements in succession, and the compiler/interpreter 
                will just keep going through them and checking their conditions until it finds one that is true. Relatedly, if you have an 
                elif statement in which multiple conditions are true, the compiler/iterpreter will only execute the code block under the 
                first elif statement in which the condition is true!
            </p>
            <h3>Boolean Functions</h3>
            <p>
                Boolean functions are functions that return True or False. Many boolean functions use conditionals. It is common for boolean 
                functions to have a name that sounds like a question, such as isDivisible or is_even_num. That way, you can call the function 
                on a value and it will either say True or False to the "question".
            </p>
            <h3>Iteration</h3>
            <p>
                Iteration is repeatedly executing the same sequence of statements. A for loop is an example of this, and there are several 
                more. Another way to do iteration is by using a while loop. This is a loop that executes the code block every time until a 
                condition is false. It is common to have a sum variable that you update every time the code block executes, and have the 
                while condition be something like "while sum != 10" or "while sum &lt; 5" so that it stops whent he sum variable reaches a 
                certain number. One thing to note is that the while loop will not stop executing the code block in the middle even if the 
                while condition becomes false in the middle, it will finish executing the entire code block and go back to the top of the 
                loop where it checks whether the condition is true. If the condition is never false, your while loop will continue executing 
                until your device runs out of space and crashes. This is called an infinite loop. A for loop is sometimes considered "definite 
                iteration" because it repeats a specific number of times, and it is harder to get an infinite loop when using a for loop. A 
                while loop can therefore be called indefinite iteration because we don't know how many times it will repeat.

            <p>
                This type of algorithm, where a sum variable is updated in a for loop for a certain number of times, is called the 
                accumulator pattern, because it is a very common format for a function.

            <h3>Function Decomposition</h3>
            <p>
                Function decomposition is not as cool as it sounds, because computer scientists love to come up with the genuinely coolest 
                names for stuff ever and then have it mean something so completely boring and useless. Function decomposition literally 
                just means breaking a problem down into smaller subproblems and using different functions on each subproblem that work 
                together to solve the problem. For example, if you wanted to add 2 squared to 3 cubed, you could use function decomposition 
                to split up the problem and make it more manageable. You could have a function that finds the square of any provided number  
                and a function that finds the cube of any provided number, then just call those on 2 and 3 respectively and add those results.
            </p>
            <h3>Function Composition</h3>
            <p>
                Function composition is the ability to build functions using other functions, or claling functions within other functions.
            </p>
            <h3>Flow of Execution</h3>
            <p>
                Flow of execution is another very cool name given to a mildly interesting topic. Flow execution refers to the order in which 
                lines of your code are called. Let's say you write a program which defines a function at the top and calls it at the bottom. 
                We will also only talk about interpreters in this case, as an interpreter is what will end up going line to line and doing 
                stuff. Your interpreter will start at the top of your code, working its way down. If it finds a function definition, it will 
                read the first line and parse it, but will see that it is a function declaration and jump to the line after the end of your 
                function. Now it will look at the line where you call the function and jump back up to where the function is 
                defined. It will then go back through that function, this time executing each step it reads. Then, once it completes the 
                function, it will return to where it originally was and continue moving down through your code. Since functions can call other 
                functions, this also leads to occasions where the interpreter goes down to the bottom where code is called, jumps to a function, 
                jumps to another function, runs that, goes back to the first function, runs that, and goes back to where the code is called.

            <h3>How to Lay Out a Python Program</h3>
            <p>
                The official and proper way of formatting your Python program is as follows: imports, function declarations, declare main method, 
                call main method. It is also typical to declare variables at the top of any functions (including main method).

            <h1>Keywords and Functions to Use While Coding</h1>
            <h3>Some Basic Python Functions to Use!</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>print()</dt>
                <dd>
                    This function displays something on the screen. If you want to display a number or 
                    variable, you can say print(5) or print(variableName). If you want to print a specific 
                    string, use quotes such as in print("Hi!")
                </dd>
                <dt>type()</dt>
                <dd>
                    This function gives the data type of a variable. It does not print that information to 
                    the screen.
                </dd>
                <dt>len()</dt>
                <dd>
                    This function tells you the number of characters in a string. It does not print that 
                    information to the screen.
                </dd>
                <dt>input()</dt>
                <dd>
                    This function asks the user for input. You can put a prompt string in the parenthesis which 
                    displays to the screen, and then the user returns the input as a string value.
                </dd>
                <dt>import __</dt>
                <dd>
                    This is not exactly a function, but it is a command used to import a module.
                </dd>
                <dt>def __():</dt>
                <dd>
                    This is a keyword that allows you to define and write your own function. The name goes in the 
                    space where the underline is and any parameters go in the parenthesis. The code that you want 
                    the function to execute goes in an indented block below this line, and the indentation ends 
                    when your code wihtin the function ends. This allows the compiler/interpreter to understand 
                    what is part of your function and what is new code outside of it.
                </dd>
                <dt>abs()</dt>
                <dd>
                    This function returns the absolute value of a number provided in the parameter. It does not 
                    print this information.
                </dd>
                <dt>max()</dt>
                <dd>
                    This function returns the maximum value out of the list provided in the parameters. It does not 
                    print this information.
                </dd>
                <dt>range():</dt>
                <dd>
                    This function returns a sequence of numbers between 0 and a specified number within the 
                    parameter. There are also other ways to call range that allow you to start at a nonzero number. 
                    This method does not print the sequence. Also, this is often used in for loops along with a 
                    counter that moves through the sequence and stops the loop once it reaches the end.
