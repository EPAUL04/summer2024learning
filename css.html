            <h2>CSS Overview</h2>
            <p>
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it is a way to style your websites. It uses different 
                style rules or rule sets to change various elements. There are three main ways to use CSS, as 
                explained below.
            </p>
            <h3>Inline Style</h3>
            <p>
                This involves using additional HTML code to add styles to your webpage. It is typically used when 
                there is just one little change you want to make. For example, I used inline style CSS in the HTML 
                page in this website to change the colors of the headings when talking about how to map a website. 
                Visually, using inline style would look like this: &lt;p style = "color: red" &gt; Special 
                &lt;/p&gt; and would create this result:
            </p>
            <p style="color: red;">Special</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Embedded Style Sheet</h3>
            <p>
                An embedded style sheet means including a portion of a stylesheet, written in CSS, within your HTML 
                code for the webpage. I have never specifically used this myself, but I imagine this would be 
                helpful when you just have a couple specific changes that you want applied to the whole document. 
                When using an embedded style sheet, the style sheet is placed within the head of the document. I 
                believe this is just convention, and I'm not sure whether the placement of the stylesheet affects 
                things. You use the &lt;style&gt; tag to show that you are including a style sheet, as shown below. 
                This set of rules would mean that every h1 element within the document would be red.
            </p>
            <p>
                &lt;head&gt; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;style&gt; <br>
                h1 {<br>
                    color: red
                <br>} <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/style&gt; <br> &lt;/head&gt;
            </p>
            <h3>External Style Sheet</h3>
            <p>
                An external style sheet is one that you write separately, in CSS, and then link inside the HTML 
                document. This is helpful when you have a lot of rule sets that you want to include, or when you 
                have rule sets affecting several different types of elements. It is also, in my understanding, 
                quite a common practice just as a way to stay organized. It is helpful to have all of your rule 
                sets in one place where they can be easily grouped, tracked, and manipulated depending on the 
                needs of the website. You link a stylesheet by using a link element as follows: &lt;link rel 
                = "stylesheet" href = "styles.css"&gt;. A link element has no closing tag.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Precedence</h2>
            <p>
                The "Cascading" in Cascading Style Sheets comes from the hierarchy of style rules it employs, 
                also called precedence or priority. There are two ways to look at this hierarchy. First, by 
                considering the breadth of the different forms of style rule sets. Secondly, you can look at the 
                priority itself that is given to each style.
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine a pyramid with the highest and smallest section being labeled "Inline", the middle section
                being labeled "Embedded", and the lowest and largest section being labeled "External".
            </p>
            <p>
                On the one 
                hand, you can look at this pyramid and see a hierarchy of size. The smallest section of the pyramid 
                is the inline section. This is because using inline CSS means that your rule sets are the <em>most</em>
                specific. The external section is the largest because using an external style sheet means that your 
                rule sets are the least specific and most broad. What this means is that the different ways of using 
                CSS impact the breadth of control that your rule sets have. You can style more elements using an 
                external style sheet, just because the nature of an external style sheet is such that you can change 
                and control what you want to happen to each element. In an inline style sheet, it is more specific 
                because it usually applies to one or two elements and usually only does one or two things. Basically, 
                an external style sheet gives you more general control over the whole document while inline CSS is 
                used to make very a couple very specific changes. Remember, inline rule sets mean that you're using 
                the style attribute within some other element. The reason that I even said this can apply to one or
                two elements instead of just one is that the span tag can be used to make sure that a specific style 
                is applied to all elements within the span element. Theoretically, you could use the span element on 
                a very large portion of the document, even the whole main section. However, using it to style more 
                than a couple elements at a time kind of indicates that maybe you should just use an embedded style 
                sheet, because it is kind of clumsy coding imo.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, there is also another way to look at this hierarchy, as previously mentioned. Instead of 
                looking at the size of the various sections, you can also look at the height of the sections. 
                Inline CSS may be the smallest/most specific section, but it also the highest up on the pyramid. 
                This is because inline style rule sets have the highest priority. External style sheets have the 
                lowest priority. This means that the document will use the rule sets in an external style sheet, 
                but if any rule sets are contradicted by an embedded style sheet, it will use those and overrule 
                the external style sheet. Similarly, if any inline style rules are applied, these will be applied 
                regardless of any external <em>or</em> internal style sheets. So if you had a rule within an 
                external style sheet that said all paragraph elements have white bold text, but a rule in an 
                embedded style sheet said that main paragraph elements have green size 14 text, and a rule in the 
                inline style sheet said that this specific paragraph element had non-bold size 8 text, you 
                would be looking at this: <span style="color: green; font-size: 8;">paragraph element</span>.
