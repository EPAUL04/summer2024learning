            <p>Make sure that your files are stored in a logical manner where they are accessible and 
                organized. Stick with one naming convention to avoid confusion. Try to find a way to 
                be both descriptive and brief.

            <h3 style="color: yellow;">Semantic Elements</h3>
            <p>The semantic elements are organizational elements within the body element. The header is 
                an element where you would put important information you want to appear at the top of 
                your webpage. It is different from the head, because you don't need to include the title 
                and meta tags. The nav is your navigation bar, which usually consists of links to other 
                pages in your website or even sections below on the same webpage. The main is the main 
                content that you want to appear on your webpage. The footer generally contains contact 
                info, dates updated or published, and any copyright info that you wish to display.
            </p>
            <h3 style="color: green;">Comments and Contents</h3>
            <p>To make a comment in HTML, use &lt;!--comment--&gt;. Comments are used to add info to your 
                code without it showing up in the actual webpage.
            </p>
            <p>Symbol Entities are special characters which can be put into a website using special codes. 
                For example, since the less than sign is a reserved character (meaning that typing it could 
                cause a text editor to read it as part of a tag and become confused), it is usually typed 
                using an entity name to prevent any errors in code. The entity name for this symbol is &amp;
                lt; and the entity name for a nonbreaking space is &amp;nbsp; which looks like this &nbsp;. 
                You can also create these characters by using their entity number. For example, this star
                &#10025; can be created by using its entity number of &amp;#10025;. Most elements have 
                both an entity name and number.
            </p>
            <p>When creating the main content of your page, there are many helpful tags. Here is a list to 
                get started, shown without the brackets.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>p: paragraph tag</li>
                <li>h1: heading 1</li>
                <li>h2: heading 2</li>
                <li>h3: heading 3</li>
                <li>ul: unordered/bulleted list</li>
                <li>ol: ordered/numbered list</li>
                <li>li: list element</li>
                <li>dl: description list, a specific type of list used for terms and their descriptions</li>
                <li>dt: description list term</li>
                <li>dd: description list definition</li>
                <li>br: creates a line break</li>
                <li>hr: creates a solid line, called a thematic break</li>
                <li>div: used to create a container element that is helpful for labeling and styling specific parts of the page</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 style="color: blue;">Validating Documents</h3>
            <p>This just means checking for errors. There are websites you can go to to check your code 
                via file upload, such as validator.w3.org
            </p>
            <h3 style="color: purple;">The Homepage</h3>
            <p>THe homepage is typically given the name index.html and serves as a place to put links to 
                more detailed pages, logos, photos, and any other important information that you want to 
                be visible at first glance.
            </p>

            <h2>Text Level Elements</h2>
            <p>&lt;strong&gt; <strong>to create bold text</strong> &lt;/strong&gt;</p>
            <p>&lt;em&gt; <em>to create italicized text</em>&lt;/q&gt;</p>
            <p>&lt;q&gt; <q>to put text in quotes</q> &lt;/q&gt;</p>
            <p>&lt;u&gt; <u>to underline text</u> &lt;/u&gt;</p>
            <p>&lt;del&gt; <del>to strikethrough text</del> &lt;/del&gt;</p>

            <h2>Images</h2>
            <p>It is common to use images in your websites. There are some ways to do this to help organize 
                and simplify the process. For example, make sure your images have clear and descriptive names
                as opposed to trying to link IMG29931. It is also common to have a folder called Images or 
                images within your project folder, just to keep them organized and out of the way.
            </p>
           <p>To place an image within your webpage, use the img tag as follows </p> 
           <p>&lt;img src = "images/filename.jpg" alt="a photo of x"&gt;</p>
           <p>The src attribute tells the tag where to get the file, and the images/ tells it to look in the 
            images folder for a jpg file with name filename. The alt attribute means that if you image doesn't 
            load for any reason, it will instead display the alt text provided. This is used to briefly 
            describe the image (eg the chipotle logo) and is different than the alt text provided alongside 
            images to thouroughly describe them to visually impaired users.
           </p>
           <p>You can also use more attributes such as height and width to describe other features of your 
            image. Additionally, it is commonplace to compress images so that they do not take up an 
            unreasonable amount of space, or to make sure they are the right file type. There are many image
            compressors online. Finally, there are certain types of files that cannot be used to display an 
            image. Some approved file types include jpg, jpeg, png, gif, and webp. Some inapplicable file 
            types include jfif, html, and .txt or .doc. These will not display an image.
           </p>

            <h2>Links</h2>
            <p>Here is a list of some link types and examples.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>hyperlink</dt>
                <dd>text, or sometimes images, that can be clicked to access other content</dd>
                <dt>anchor tag</dt>
                <dd>the HTML tag used to link content on a webpage</dd>
                <dd>eg: &lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;</dd>
                <dt>relative link</dt>
                <dd>hyperlink to another file on your computer</dd>
                <dd>eg: &lt;a href="images/seadragon.jpeg"&gt;Photo of Seadragon&lt;/a&gt;</dd>
                <dt>image link</dt>
                <dd>a link which displays an image on the screen instead of text</dd>
                <dd>&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;&lt;img src="images/file.jpg" alt= "file description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</dd>
                <dt>absolute link</dt>
                <dd>hyperlink to external content via URL</dd>
                <dd>&lt;a href="https://pastawebsite.com"&gt;Pasta&lt;/a&gt;</dd>
                <dt>email link</dt>
                <dd>a link directly connected to an email address</dd>
                <dd>&lt;a href="mailto: email.address@gmail.com"&gt;Email me here!&lt;/a&gt;</dd>
                <dt>phone number link</dt>
                <dd>a link directly connected to a phone number</dd>
                <dd>&lt;a href="tel: +1##########"&gt;Call me here!&lt;/a&gt;</dd>
                <dd>*note: make sure to include country code here!</dd>
                <dt>embedded map</dt>
                <dd>you can actually get a link from google maps that is set up to be embedded in a webpage!</dd>
                <dd>go to google maps -> share -> embed a map -> copy html and you should get an iframe element tag</dd>
                <dd></dd>
            </dl>
            <p>Note that the source your link takes you to is generally located in the href attribute, or src in 
                the case of images. The text between the opening and closing tags will be what appears on the 
                screen in the case of text links. Also, you can add attributes to your links to specify the manner 
                in which they open. My favorite is target="_blank" which opens the link in a new tab!
