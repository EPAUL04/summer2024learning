            <h2>CSS Overview</h2>
            <p>
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it is a way to style your websites. It uses different 
                style rules or rule sets to change various elements. There are three main ways to use CSS, as 
                explained below.
            </p>
            <h3>Inline Style</h3>
            <p>
                This involves using additional HTML code to add styles to your webpage. It is typically used when 
                there is just one little change you want to make. For example, I used inline style CSS in the HTML 
                page in this website to change the colors of the headings when talking about how to map a website. 
                Visually, using inline style would look like this: &lt;p style = "color: red" &gt; Special 
                &lt;/p&gt; and would create this result:
            </p>
            <p style="color: red;">Special</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Embedded Style Sheet</h3>
            <p>
                An embedded style sheet means including a portion of a stylesheet, written in CSS, within your HTML 
                code for the webpage. I have never specifically used this myself, but I imagine this would be 
                helpful when you just have a couple specific changes that you want applied to the whole document. 
                When using an embedded style sheet, the style sheet is placed within the head of the document. I 
                believe this is just convention, and I'm not sure whether the placement of the stylesheet affects 
                things. You use the &lt;style&gt; tag to show that you are including a style sheet, as shown below. 
                This set of rules would mean that every h1 element within the document would be red.
            </p>
            <p>
                &lt;head&gt; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;style&gt; <br>
                h1 {<br>
                    color: red
                <br>} <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/style&gt; <br> &lt;/head&gt;
            </p>
            <h3>External Style Sheet</h3>
            <p>
                An external style sheet is one that you write separately, in CSS, and then link inside the HTML 
                document. This is helpful when you have a lot of rule sets that you want to include, or when you 
                have rule sets affecting several different types of elements. It is also, in my understanding, 
                quite a common practice just as a way to stay organized. It is helpful to have all of your rule 
                sets in one place where they can be easily grouped, tracked, and manipulated depending on the 
                needs of the website. You link a stylesheet by using a link element as follows: &lt;link rel 
                = "stylesheet" href = "styles.css"&gt;. A link element has no closing tag.
