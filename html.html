            <p>Make sure that your files are stored in a logical manner where they are accessible and 
                organized. Stick with one naming convention to avoid confusion. Try to find a way to 
                be both descriptive and brief.

            <h3 style="color: yellow;">Semantic Elements</h3>
            <p>The semantic elements are organizational elements within the body element. The header is 
                an element where you would put important information you want to appear at the top of 
                your webpage. It is different from the head, because you don't need to include the title 
                and meta tags. The nav is your navigation bar, which usually consists of links to other 
                pages in your website or even sections below on the same webpage. The main is the main 
                content that you want to appear on your webpage. The footer generally contains contact 
                info, dates updated or published, and any copyright info that you wish to display.
            </p>
            <h3 style="color: green;">Comments and Contents</h3>
            <p>To make a comment in HTML, use &lt;!--comment--&gt;. Comments are used to add info to your 
                code without it showing up in the actual webpage.
            </p>
            <p>Symbol Entities are special characters which can be put into a website using special codes. 
                For example, since the less than sign is a reserved character (meaning that typing it could 
                cause a text editor to read it as part of a tag and become confused), it is usually typed 
                using an entity name to prevent any errors in code. The entity name for this symbol is &amp;
                lt; and the entity name for a nonbreaking space is &amp;nbsp; which looks like this &nbsp;. 
                You can also create these characters by using their entity number. For example, this star
                &#10025; can be created by using its entity number of &amp;#10025;. Most elements have 
                both an entity name and number.
            </p>
            <p>When creating the main content of your page, there are many helpful tags. Here is a list to 
                get started, shown without the brackets.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>p: paragraph tag</li>
                <li>h1: heading 1</li>
                <li>h2: heading 2</li>
                <li>h3: heading 3</li>
                <li>ul: unordered/bulleted list</li>
                <li>ol: ordered/numbered list</li>
                <li>li: list element</li>
                <li>dl: description list, a specific type of list used for terms and their descriptions</li>
                <li>dt: description list term</li>
                <li>dd: description list definition</li>
                <li>br: creates a line break</li>
                <li>hr: creates a solid line, called a thematic break</li>
                <li>div: used to create a container element that is helpful for labeling and styling specific parts of the page</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 style="color: blue;">Validating Documents</h3>
            <p>This just means checking for errors. There are websites you can go to to check your code 
                via file upload, such as validator.w3.org
            </p>
            <h3 style="color: purple;">The Homepage</h3>
            <p>THe homepage is typically given the name index.html and serves as a place to put links to 
                more detailed pages, logos, photos, and any other important information that you want to 
                be visible at first glance.
            </p>

            <h2>Text Level Elements</h2>
            <p>&lt;strong&gt; <strong>to create bold text</strong> &lt;/strong&gt;</p>
            <p>&lt;em&gt; <em>to create italicized text</em>&lt;/q&gt;</p>
            <p>&lt;q&gt; <q>to put text in quotes</q> &lt;/q&gt;</p>
            <p>&lt;u&gt; <u>to underline text</u> &lt;/u&gt;</p>
            <p>&lt;del&gt; <del>to strikethrough text</del> &lt;/del&gt;</p>

            <h2>Images</h2>
            <p>It is common to use images in your websites. There are some ways to do this to help organize 
                and simplify the process. For example, make sure your images have clear and descriptive names
                as opposed to trying to link IMG29931. It is also common to have a folder called Images or 
                images within your project folder, just to keep them organized and out of the way.
